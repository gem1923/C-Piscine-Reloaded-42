# C Piscine Reloaded

This repository contains the validated solution set for the "C Piscine Reloaded" project at Ã‰cole 42.

## Objective

To reinforce the fundamentals of the C programming language through a collection of small, self-contained exercises. 
Each exercise focuses on one core concept, such as string manipulation, pointer usage, or number printing.

## Project Structure

Each directory (`ex00` to `ex27`) contains:

- A single `.c` file implementing the required function.
- The exercises build progressively, starting from basic output to more complex string operations.

Refer to the included `en.subject.pdf` for detailed instructions.

## Compilation

Each exercise can be compiled independently using:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror exXX/filename.c -o test
